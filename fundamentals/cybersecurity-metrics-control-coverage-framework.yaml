  # Main Documentation (All Embedded in YAML)
  documentation:
    overview:
      summary: "Master comprehensive security analytics through structured metrics frameworks, control coverage matrices, and advanced dashboard implementations for data-driven security governance"
      importance: "Organizations cannot manage what they cannot measure. Effective security requires quantifiable metrics, systematic control coverage analysis, and real-time visibility into security posture. This framework enables evidence-based security decisions and demonstrates security value to business stakeholders."
      scope: "Covers control coverage matrices, security metrics taxonomies, dashboard design, automated analytics, compliance measurement, and business intelligence integration"
      key_concepts: 
        - concept: "Control Coverage Matrix"
