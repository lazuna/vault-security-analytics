levels:
  - level: 0
    title: "Undefined"
    description: >
      Security is ad hoc, undocumented, and reactive. No defined ownership or standards.

  - level: 1
    title: "Basic Policy"
    description: >
      Minimal controls exist, typically due to compliance pressure. Policies are drafted but enforcement is weak or manual.

  - level: 2
    title: "Reactive + Visible"
    description: >
      Teams react to incidents with visible security controls. Some monitoring, logs, and checklists are in place, but no proactive strategies.

  - level: 3
    title: "Proactive Automation"
    description: >
      Security is embedded into workflows. Automated detection, preventive controls, and IaC scanning are operational. Risk ownership is distributed.

  - level: 4
    title: "Adaptive & Governed"
    description: >
      Security evolves with threats. Feedback loops from incident learning, red teaming, and business risk inform continuous improvement. Governance is data-driven and systemic.
